abstract: The remarkable economic development in Indonesia from the 1970s through the 1990s cannot be separated from the role that its manufacturing sector played during the same period. As an important engine of growth, the manufacturing sector helped Indonesia in the process of capital accumulation, technology transfer, and productivity growth. However, since the Asian Financial Crisis (AFC) in 1997–1998, the manufacturing sector has tended to grow slower and its share to GDP began to decline in 2001. The purpose of this study is to analyze the determinants of deindustrialization in Indonesia by examining three hypotheses, which are the Secular, Dutch Disease, and Trade hypotheses. Our findings show that all hypotheses hold the econometric ground of cointegration. From a policy standpoint, the results imply that proper exchange rate management and promotion of industries that cater to expanding domestic demand could be effective policies to boost manufacturing share to GDP again.

abstract: Reducing regional income disparities is a central challenge for promoting sustainable development in Indonesia. In particular, the prospect for these disparities to be reduced in the post-decentralization period has become a major concern for policymakers in Indonesia. Motivated by this background, this paper re-examines the regional convergence hypothesis at the district level in Indonesia over the 2000-2017 period. Using a novel data set, this study investigates the formation of multiple convergence clubs using non-linear dynamic factor model. The results indicate that Indonesian districts form five convergence clubs, implying that the growth of income per capita in 514 districts can be clustered into five common trends. From the lens of spatial distribution, two common occasions can be observed. First, districts belonging to the the same province tend be in the same club and second, the highest club is dominated by districts with specific characteristic (i.e., big cities or natural resources rich regions). From a policy standpoint, the identification of multiple convergence clubs at significantly different levels of income allows regional policy makers to identify districts facing similar challenges.

abstract: Using a novel dataset, this paper studies the spatio-temporal dynamics of income per capita across provinces and districts in Indonesia over the 2000-2017 period. First, an exploratory spatial analysis suggests that spatial autocorrelation is only significant at the district level and it appears to be robust from 2013 to 2017. Thus, at the district level, we proceed to use a spatial filtering model for decomposing income into a spatially independent component and a spatial residual. Next, through the lens of a distributional convergence framework, we find that the non-filtered income is characterized by a lack of regional mobility. In contrast, the spatially independent component shows a pattern of polarization. We conclude arguing that neighbor effects have played a significant role in reducing regional polarization in Indonesia.
